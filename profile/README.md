# Lab 1 - Behavioral robotics
### Assignment
1. Write the theoretical equations for the unicycle model, the differential drive model, and the connection between these models when designing for the unicycle model.
2. Expand the unicycle model to include the model of the differential drive robot
3. Load the maze and import it to your script
4. Design the three necessary behaviors:

    Go to goal
    Avoid obstacles - this is basically only needed as a prerequisite for the follow-wall behavior.
    Follow wall

5. Plot the trajectory of the robot through the maze
6. 3 subplots with x with time, y with time, and θ ref compared to θ with respect to time.
7. You should present your work in a report that includes the aforementioned equations, the plots, a description of how you designed the different behaviors, and what values you used for the different control parameters.
9. Additionally to the report, the code and the Simulink model should be submitted as well.
